The efi is very finicky on this device so to
fix this problem, you need to download the file
from the link below, 

https://edk2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/edk2/trunk/edk2/EdkShellBinPkg/FullShell/X64/Shell_Full.efi

Rename it to shellx64.efi and put it into /efi/boot
directory, when fully flashed. (You need rufus to
the file to be copied, when prompted, select ISO mode 
when writing.)
